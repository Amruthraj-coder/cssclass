<!-- Make a an element using the tag main, this tag is used to signify main content
     of a page. Give that tag a class of Accio and id Job.

Inside the main element create another element for paragraph giving it
 a class of hello-accio-job. It should contain the text Hello Accio Job exactly.

This is all we need to do for the styling part.

Using CSS style the main element to have width and height of 150px and black as background color.

Now to solve the issue of paragraph text not visible style the paragraph t
to have text color white and also give it a margin left of 32px and padding of 10px. -->
